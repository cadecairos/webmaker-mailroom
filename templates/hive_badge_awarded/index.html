  <h3>Why is this badge important? This and future Hive badges will help us to...</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Define a Hive culture and identity & earn community status;</li>
    <li>Facilitate peer recognition and make visible activity deserving recognition;</li>
    <li>Illuminate new contexts to sharpen our skills;</li>
    <li>Demonstrate that we are achieving our mission;</li>
    <li>Provide clarity around expectations and requirements;</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Hive Community Member badge, and future Hive badges, will recognize individual professional contributions to the Hive ecosystem on both local and global scales.</h3>

  <p>Any Hive generally consists of organizations: museums, educational non-profits, government agencies, schools, etc. However, individuals from these organizations really breathe life into the Hive, and their professional commitment and peer-to-peer learning is what translates into amazing opportunities and experiences for young people. This badge designates your individual role in the Hive ecosystem, rather than the status of your organization.</p>

  <h3>What's next?</h3>

  <p>Spread the word about this badge to your peers in your local Hive network, or collaborators that you feel have made a contribution to Hive <em>even if they have not been recognized through the Hive before!</em> Our badges help us to define our community and our community will help us to define our badges.</p>
